## Release v1.7.1

This release brings several user experience enhancements and bug fixes to Make It Rain!

**Key Highlights:**

*   **✨ Enhanced Collection Selection (Fetch Modal):** Easily select collections from a dynamic, filterable list populated directly from your Raindrop.io account when fetching your bookmarks! This is in addition to the existing manual ID/name entry.
*   **📄 Improved Template Editing:** Reset your main and content-type specific templates to their defaults with new "Reset to Default" buttons in the settings.
*   **↔️ Better Layout for Inputs:** Input fields in modals and template editing areas are now stacked below their descriptions, providing more space and better readability.
*   **❓ Contextual Help Links:** Look for new `(?)` help icons next to complex settings that link directly to our documentation.
*   **🚀 Quick Import Fixes:** The Quick Import feature now more reliably parses Raindrop item IDs and provides clearer instructions on how to find them.

**Other Changes:**

*   Resolved a CI build issue to ensure smoother automated builds.
